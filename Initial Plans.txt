HC-SR04 sensor x6
=>
left side
right side
front 
back 
top of arm/claw

Arduino UNO R3 
USB 2.0 A to B cable

Connecting all HC-SR04 sensors in parrallel through a 5v pin on the arduino. 
All connected through to same ground pin on arduino.

mounts designed in CAD and 3D printed

need to find a way to take data from each individual and send over serial in a way that is uniquely identifiable, 
so that it can be processed correctly on the client/OCU side

initial solutions to unique identification=>
when sending over serial, send unique indentifier at start of each string, such as:
sl, sr, sf, sb and st for sensor left, sensor right, sensor front, sensor back and sensor top respectively

Arduino Uno has 13 digital pins available, therefore, there is the potential for 6 HC-SR04 sensors overall

using NewPing library, should give me the abiliy to manage indidual sensors, if not then other solution 
needs to be found

should be able to use NewPing library using command => NewPing sensor1(11,12,200),where sensor1 is name of sensor,
